# 🧠 Slagalica – Web Implementation

A web-based implementation of a collection of logic and language mini-games inspired by the popular Serbian TV quiz **Slagalica**, which has been airing continuously since **1993** and is considered one of the longest-running and most beloved quiz shows in Serbia.

This app faithfully recreates several iconic games featured in the show, such as *Slagalica* (word forming) and *Asocijacije* (associations), while also reviving some games that were once part of the show but are no longer aired. Additionally, it introduces original games created specifically for this web version, enriching the user experience and offering fresh challenges.
